# cvl3.1

Professional site for my artwork. Includes SFW query string flag to share a link to site without NSFW artworks on homepage. Site can be easily updated via the works.json, eventually a custom CMS will be built in maybe C# and MongoDB but for now it's easy to copy pasta artworks into the JSON.

Built In VueJS as Vue allows for fairly quick buildouts of simple sites compared to Angular, and without the possble tangle that React can end up in.

That being said, the next build _will_ be Angular or React with Material.
