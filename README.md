# cvl3.1

Professional site for my artwork. Includes SFW query string flag to share a link to site without NSFW artworks on homepage.

Built In VueJS as Vue allows for fairly quick buildouts of simple sites compared to Angular, and without the possble tangle that React can end up in.

That being said, the next build _will_ be Angular or React with Material.
