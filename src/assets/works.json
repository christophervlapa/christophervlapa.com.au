		"artistsStatement": "<p><em>Little More Real</em> takes the channels of commercial oppression and reverts them back to the originally intended use of the Internet: of communication free of commercial and capitalist intent.</p><p>This is not a deconstruction, this is a reconstruction. By breaking down past and present cultural structures and physically dismantling visual tropes from the ephemera of the everyday then relocating these fragments into the artwork, and arranging them into a new visual language.</p><p>By using new digital channels for the distribution of works that would in the past only be distributed in zines, the two distinct mediums now work as one to disrupt the cultural hegemony presented both by the printed advertisements that form the foundation medium of this work, and in the space they now inhabit that would otherwise have been used to sell tennis shoes, fad diets and such.</p><p>Advertising itself is a tool of oppression, not only of minorities but of all that are subjected to it’s forced narrative. Little More Real seeks to disrupt that narrative, to strip away the constructs presented in advertising with the tools of juxtaposition, non sequitur and humor, the truth within the imagery is crystallized and amplified.</p><p>None of this is new. The path of collage has been well traveled since the Dadaists in the 1930s, through to the suggested #collage hashtag on Tumblr that you may have found these works through. What is new here is the use of online advertising for artistic intent, the paid digital equivalent to graffiti. You didn’t have a choice of the adverts in your Facebook newsfeed, now you don’t have a choice but to confront the themes of this artwork.</p><p>We hope that you enjoy your time here, and the small break from the constant barrage of capitalist oppression we hope to give you.</p><p class=\"bold\">- CVL</p><hr><p>I used to have a problem being real with other people. I used to feel like I had to be perfect, unfazed, above it all, keep it together, ambitious.</p><p><em>Little More Real</em> is an expression of the more mundane aspects of my personality:</p><ul><li>Show(wo)manship masking severe confusion</li><li>Gratitude masking low mood</li><li>Lustfulness masking insecurity</li><li>Glamour masking standoffishness</li></ul><p>These collages are a small part of the imperfect me that I’m happy to share on social media, albeit detached from my social profile (one step at a time). Being less than perfect on social media is sacrosanct. Why be less when it’s so easy to hide, retouch, masquerade? I’d rather not hide from myself any more. I haven’t got it together. I am, unfortunately, human.</p><p>All of the source images I’ve used are aimed at women, from “fabulousness is next to godliness” fashion bibles, “prim-and-proper” Womens Weekly’s, “hostess-with-the-mostest” food magazines and “YOLO” youth street press. My perception of the world has been shaped by these mass media for my entire life. LMR is a small way of flipping that on its head–instead of consuming messaging I’m creating it for myself. I’d rather give birth to a window of imagination than be enticed to buy, compare myself to others or be lulled into thinking that a utopia exists.</p><p>Mass media is outward looking, my nature is inward looking (sometimes to my own detriment). Using mass media as the paint rather than the teacher, I’ve explored my interior. There is so much information reshaping our beliefs each day that it’s a worthwhile exercise to hack the source in order to explore how it’s shaping your thinking.</p><p class=\"bold\">- SH</p>",

		"artistsStatement": "<p>The Australian Flag is symbolic of Australian national identity and as such is representative of both our dark colonial past and our unique position within the global landscape as a place of hope for many. The Australian Flag has a history that is as unique, although the design came into popular use in 1901 it was not the national or only flag of Australia until 1954. As such, it has had a brief history as a relatively brief defining symbol for Australian people. In light of its brief history, it is extremely concerning that in recent times it has been co-opted by hate mongers and worse to be used as a prop for cartoonish media broadcasts by our leaders, a backdrop for radicals of all stripes and yet burned by others.</p><p>In contrast to this national symbol, during the protests of the Global Financial Crisis we saw masked protesters known as The Black Bloc: dressed head to toe in black, on the front lines of anger against the financial institutions that led us over the financial brink they expressed the frustration of many with their direct actions. Many of these protesters carried The Black Flag, the international symbol for Anarchy and resistance. Taking this black flag, a powerful symbol from my previous works (Enemies of Everything 2001, Untitled 2010) and applying it to our national symbol a new symbol is generated, one of resistance: resistance against tyranny, against oppression and a preparedness to never surrender until these tyrannies and oppressions are ended. The Black Flag in and of itself the antithesis of the White Flag of surrender.</p><p>By displaying the work as multiple professionally produced flags, a black mirror is raised up to reflect those standing in ever growing numbers behind our leaders who no longer represent an educated public opinion. They offer a reminder that there are those of us that are not willing to accept the continued insults to our home, ourselves, our intelligence and our future. These flags are  devoid of colour: their black is an absence, a negation of the familiar symbols contained in the flag. They become unified and of a single purpose rather than collections of symbols. The richness and uniformity of the black in the professionally produced flags is indicative of the desire for inclusivity and equal representation within Australian. These flags are not meant to represent just one part of Australia, they are made for all who want to see this country progress forward instead of move backward. They are a statement of commitment to this cause and belief in the Australian people, of resistance, of outrage and of hope for the future. </p>",

The series <span class=\"italics\">Falling for Shadows</span> illustrates the human form using shadows captured by pushing the rigid structure of studio photography until it falters and produces what is usually taken as error, in this case harsh shadows, but in this series becomes the focus of the work.</p><p>The use of the human form in <span class=\"italics\">Falling for Shadows</span> is suggestive of the memories that we have of friends, family or lovers that have taken leave from our lives and left in their place vague shapes and emotions, half remembered and half imagined in our minds. The simplicity of the works allows the viewer to place their own memories within the frame, placing their memories with that of the artist.</p>",
